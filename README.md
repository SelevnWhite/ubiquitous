=========

A server-side library for sending Push Notifications to iOS (iPhone/iPad APNS), Android (C2DM), Windows Phone, and Blackberry devices!

------------------------------
There's finally some code available here to look at, but I must warn you, this code is completely untested as of now!  I mean it, I haven't even confirmed that the Push Channels can actually send notifications successfully!  It compiles, but past that, venture here at your own risk!  

I will obviously start trying to do some testing in the near future, but until then, feel free to fork it, watch it, play with it, and let me know of any obvious mistakes or errors!  Thanks!
