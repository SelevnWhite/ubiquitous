PushSharp
=========

A server-side library for sending Push Notifications to iOS (iPhone/iPad APNS), Android (C2DM), Windows Phone, and Blackberry devices!


Coming Soon!
------------
I'm knee deep in code right now, and haven't done any testing yet, but I think the plumbing is mostly ready for iOS and Android push notifications!

The goal of this library is to create a semi-abstracted, unified framework for delivery push notifications to mobile devices.  I've learned a bit from my APNS-Sharp and C2DM-Sharp libraries and am hoping to take this to the next level!
